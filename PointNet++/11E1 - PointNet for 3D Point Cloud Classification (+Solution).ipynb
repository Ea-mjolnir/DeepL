Your suggested task in the end will be to also implement PointNet with the other type of convolutional layers. So, you should do it in both ways to get more familiar with convolutional filters.\n",

    "In order to use a 2D convolutional layer, the input tensor must have 4 dimensions: batch size (B), number of points(N), 1 (in our case to make it 4 dimensional), and channels (C). Using the dimensions in this way, the filter size is (1, 1). If you decide to exchange the 3rd and 4th dimension, and you end up with BxNx3x1, then your filter size is (1,3). Remember that you do not provide the last dimension (the number of channels) in the convolutional filter. Either way, after the first layer, the network will be the same, and the features derived through the convolutional layers will be in the last dimension. Then, (1,1) convolutional filters are used. The dimensions of the input need to be provided to the Input layer.\n",

The layers of the MLPs are each composed of a 2D convolutional layer, followed by batch normalization, and a ReLU activation layer. After 5 layers for the first MLP, there is a max pooling layer, and another (second) MLP with 3 layers. In between the 2nd and the 3rd layer (of the second MLP), a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.3 can help the training process. The last layer of the second MLP does not have batch normalization or an activation layer. Or rather, a softmax activation layer is used to generate the 9 class scores. \n",

Your (optional) task later on will be to inject intensity, number of returns, and return number that is also provided by the ISPRS data for the point cloud into the network after the feature extraction (after max pooling). In the functional model, you need to provide the sequence of layers by defining the output of the previous layer to be the input of the current layer.\n",

    "In this exercise, we used PointNet as a feature encoder for points with their 20-point neighborhood for the classification of 3D point clouds. The feature encoding is the part until (including) max pooling. What follows is a typical classification network with fully connected layers that are implemented with convolutional filters and with softmax . (A convolutional filter that has the same size as the input has the same effect as a fully connected layer. Only the interpretation of the data is different with regard to tensor dimensions.)\n",

    "- The laser beam is typically not going straight downwards, so there is a tilt in its direction. The different returns (of the same beam) at different elevation levels, lead to 3D points with different x,y-coordinates. Therefore, all points have individual coordinates and the return number denotes the \"index\" of the return it was derived from."
